# TanLineAnalysis
Quick notebook to analyze tan lines using convolutional edge detection filters

I have an ongoing debate with my girlfriend over who has the better Birkenstock tan lines. She made a poll on Instagram that she won 60%/40%. To settle this debate, I used a convolutional sobel filter to detect tan lines and plotted the results. The edge-filtered image shows that her tan line has greater contrast, but is poorly-defined with no tan line for the bottom of the Birkenstock strap. My tan line, on the other hand has a very crisp edge and both sides of the Birkenstock strap are visible. I would argue that this proves that my Birkenstock tan lines are superior.

Packages used: openCV(cv2), numpy, matplotlib, seaborn.
